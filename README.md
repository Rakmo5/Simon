## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
By building this project, I practiced:  
- DOM manipulation using **jQuery**  
- Handling **events** (`click`, `keypress`)  
- Using **setInterval** and callbacks for sequencing  
- State management with variables like `level`, `started`, `acceptingInput`, `highScore`  
- Implementing **game over** and **restart logic**

## 🔑 How to Play
1. Press any key (or tap screen on mobile) to start.  
2. Watch the sequence of flashing colors.  
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons.  
4. Each level adds one more step to the sequence.  
5. Wrong input? Game Over! Restart and try to beat your **highest level**.
